Movie Theater Read Me
-----------------------------------------

To compile the program:

- Need to have the movies.src file
- Run from MovieTheater

NOTE:
---------------------------------------

- If you have no movies showing up, check the movies text files and make sure the dates are set to the day you are accessing the program and that some of the dates are within the week you are accessing the program. it works if the dates are set to the day you are accessing and some day within 7 days from the day you are acessing the program. we tried to set the dayes so that they would be accessible around the time the project is graded. 

- Management password is "Group18" for adding/editing movies
